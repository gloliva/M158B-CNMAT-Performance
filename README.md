## Event Overview



## Media From the Event

![xbox-kinect](photos/xbox-kinect.JPG)

An Xbox-Kinect was places in the main walking path to record human skeletal data. As audience members would walk by, the movements of their arms, legs, and head would affect the projected visual, causing it to warp, expand, pulse, and ripple.

Projected images were mapped to hanging panels, structural columns, and the ceiling. The mapping was done using Isadora, and the color changes and animations were hanlded via Max/MSP.

Audience members could enter the recording room and speak / sing / shout into the microphone. The audio was heavily processed by mutliple computers to deconstruct the sound into grains and then reconstruct the grains to create a wave of sound to fill the performance space.
